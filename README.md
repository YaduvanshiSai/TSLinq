## Contributions

tl;dr; This is a readonly repository.

This project was created because I was having fun implementing this stuff, it wasn't tested enough and it doesn't have enough tests covering it. I don't have any plans to make it bigger, there is already `lodash` that is maintained by a lot of people.

It is not recommented to use in production, look for `lodash` for something solid.
